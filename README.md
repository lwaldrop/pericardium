# pericardium
Laura's Pericardium code

This code uses the 2D Immersed Boundary Method to simulate fluid flow driven by a flexible 'heart' tube through a racetrack circulatory system using a neuromechanical model of pumping. Simulations are run with and without a pericardium, or a stiff boundary that encases the flexible heart to compare differences in pumping. 

The code is set up to run on UNC-CH's Kure cluster.
